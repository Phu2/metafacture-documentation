# metafacture-documentation

The central place for documentation about Metafacture.

Our goal with this repo is to collaboratively create comprehensive documentation on Metafacture in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-documentation/issues?q=). Feel free to open issues not only for bugs or enhancements, but also questions about Metafacture usage, or to share your experiences. We hope that over time, in that way we can create useful tutorials, how-tos, and collect good practices for using Metafacture.
